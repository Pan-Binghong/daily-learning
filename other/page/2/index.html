Apache Licence是著名的非盈利开源组织Apache采用的协议。该协议和BSD类似，同样鼓励代码共享和最终原作者的著作权，同样允许源代码修改和再发布。但是也需要遵循以下条件：
需要给代码的用户一份Apache Licence。
如果修改了代码，需要再被修改的文件中说明。
在衍生的代码中（修改和有源代码衍生的代码中）需要带有原来代码中的协议，商标，专利声明和其他原来作者规定需要包含的说明。
如果再发布的产品中包含一个Notice文件，则在Notice文件中需要带有Apache Licence。你可以再Notice中增加自己的许可，但是不可以表现为对Apache Licence构成更改。
Apache Licence也是对商业应用友好的许可。使用者也可以再需要的时候修改代码来满足并作为开源或商业产品发布/销售。 使用这个协议的好处是:
永久权利 一旦被授权，永久拥有。
全球范围的权利 在一个国家获得授权，适用于所有国家。假如你在美国，许可是从印度授权的，也没有问题。
授权免费 无版税， 前期、后期均无任何费用。
授权无排他性 任何人都可以获得授权
授权不可撤消 一旦获得授权，没有任何人可以取消。比如，你基于该产品代码开发了衍生产品，你不用担心会在某一天被禁止使用该代码
